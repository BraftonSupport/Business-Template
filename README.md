### Quickstart ###
Note: Doesn't work locally, I dunno.

How to build a page:
1. Build out a parent page using the parent template.
2. Build a child page with the parent page as parent and using the subsection template.
  * There are 7 types of subsections:
    1. Visual (banner)
    2. Services or List
    3. Validation (slider)
    4. Half
    5. Full
    6. CTA
    7. Map
  * Select a color or a Featured Image to use as the background of a section. The Visual subsection can also use a video url as the background.
  * You can change the order the subsections appear in the page attributes.
  * The tracking doesn't work. ¯\\(•_•)/¯
